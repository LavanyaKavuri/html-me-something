        The Taj is the beauty personified! The Taj displays 
        its different moods through its varied shades. 
        The Taj has as many shades as any kind of beauty can ever 
        have! The Taj is pinkish in the morning, milky white in 
        the evening, golden when the moon shines and the intermediary 
        variants during different hours of the day and during different 
        seasons in a year.</p>

    <p class="sec">Hampi, also referred to as the Group of Monuments at Hampi, 
    is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO/" 
    target="_blank">UNESCO</a>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site/" target="_blank">World Heritage Site</a>   located in east-central Karnataka, 
    India.[1] It became the centre of the Hindu Vijayanagara Empire
     capital in the 14th century.[2] Chronicles left by Persian and
    European travellers, particularly the Portuguese, state Hampi
    was a prosperous, wealthy and grand city near the Tungabhadra
  River, with numerous temples, farms and trading markets.
         By 1500 CE, Hampi-Vijayanagara was the world's 
         second-largest medieval-era city after Beijing, and probably 
         India's richest at that time, attracting traders from Persia
          and Portugal.[3][4] The Vijayanagara Empire was defeated by 
          a coalition of Muslim sultanates; its capital was conquered,
           pillaged and destroyed by sultanate armies in 1565, after 
           which Hampi remained in ruins</p>

   <h3>Brief synthesis</h3>
 <p class="sun">The Sun Temple at Konârak, located on the eastern shores of 
 the Indian subcontinent, is one of the outstanding examples of
  temple architecture and art as revealed in its conception, scale
   and proportion, and in the 
 sublime narrative strength of its sculptural embellishment</p>   
    </div>

<div>
        <h3>Criterion (i):</h3>
    <p class ="sun1">
 A unique artistic achievement, the temple has raised up those
  lovely legends which are affiliated everywhere with absolute
   works of art: its construction 
 caused the mobilization of 1,200 workers for 12 years.</p>
</div>
<div>
